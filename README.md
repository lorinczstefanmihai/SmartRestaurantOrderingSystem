## 📘 Overview

This project implements a smart restaurant ordering system designed to reduce wait times and improve the ordering experience. The system allows customers to place requests effortlessly, while waiters and staff receive real-time notifications.

The complete system consists of three main components:

1. Table Call Button – placed on the client’s table for calling a waiter.

2. Waiter’s Watch Display – shows which table requires service and waiting time.

3. Windows Application – displayed on a large screen in the dining area for centralized monitoring.
